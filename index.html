        <h2>What is Volcanic Erruption?</h2>
        <p>A volcanic eruption is a natural phenomenon where magma (molten rock), gases, and ash are expelled from a volcano onto the Earth’s surface or into the atmosphere.  This occurs when pressure builds beneath the Earth’s crust due to the movement of tectonic plates, forcing magma upward through cracks or vents. As magma rises, decreasing pressure allows dissolved gases (like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide) to form bubbles, increasing internal pressure and leading to explosive or effusive eruptions.

         <h3>Causes of volcanic erruption</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Magma Formation and Buoyancy: Volcanic eruptions begin when magma, molten or partially molten rock, forms in the Earth's mantle due to heat, pressure changes, or the addition of water that lowers the melting point of surrounding rock.  Because magma is less dense than the surrounding solid rock, it rises toward the surface.</li>
            <li>Pressure Buildup from Gases: As magma ascends, decreasing pressure allows dissolved gases—such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide—to form bubbles.  These bubbles expand rapidly, increasing internal pressure within the magma chamber. This gas pressure is a primary driver of explosive eruptions, similar to opening a shaken soda bottle.</li>
            <li>Tectonic Activity and Plate Movements: Most volcanoes form at plate boundaries.  At subduction zones, one tectonic plate sinks beneath another, releasing water that triggers melting in the mantle.  At divergent boundaries, plates pull apart, allowing magma to rise.  Hotspots, like those under Hawaii, involve mantle plumes that melt through the crust, creating volcanic chains. </li>
            <li>Eruption Trigger: When the upward pressure from magma and expanding gases exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, cracks form, and magma forces its way through the crust via vents or fissures.  The eruption occurs when this pressure is released at the surface, ejecting lava, ash, and gases. </li>
